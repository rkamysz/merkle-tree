# Merkle Tree

This repository was specifically created for recruitment purposes. The solution presented here is not complete â€“ I would like to discuss the details during the interview. The code contains an implementation of the logic to create and search a Merkle tree, as well as an API to handle it.

## How to Run

```bash

# run dynamodb-local
docker run -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local

# fill in the variables in the env.example file (if you will use a local database, also set database_url)
# move .env.example to ./cdk.out/asset...../.env # or just rename it to .env

# build and run api
1. yarn build
2. yarn synth
3. yarn start # if you are using .env from ./cdk.out/asset.... folder
# or
3. sam local start-api # if you are using .env from root folder
```

In the postman directory you will find api and environment jsons that can be imported or you can use curl:

```bash
curl --location --request POST '127.0.0.1:3000/create/8'
curl --location '127.0.0.1:3000/node/5'
```

## Code Structure

The repository consists of the following folders: `api` and `lib` and inside `app`, `core`, and `storage`. This structure suggests a division of the code into npm packages, which I would apply in a full-fledged project. The goal is to improve scalability, reduce code duplication, and allow integration with various sources in the future.

- **core**: Contains basic elements and interfaces used in all the framework's modules.
  
- **app**: Focuses on the logic defined in this task, i.e., creating the tree and searching for nodes by index.

- **storage**: An example module with implementations of different data containers, such as DynamoDB, MongoDB, Redis, etc.

- **api**: Implementation of the API based on AWS API Gateway and lambdas.

This division allows for easy adaptation of the logic to different platforms, the use of various data containers, and scaling of the solution.

## Inversion of Control (IoC)

The application's code and database components rely on the Inversion of Control (IoC) mechanism, using the `inversify` library in this case. This makes it easy to manage components; simply initialize them in the container before launching the API.

## Clean Architecture

The code is based on the principles of `Clean Architecture`. While it may seem complicated in the presented example, it's a practical approach, especially when extending and scaling the code. This ensures mobility of logic that is not directly related to external tools and libraries.

- **Controller**: Serves as the starting point where methods are handlers for specific operations.

- **Use case**: Components where the main logic is executed.

- **Repository**: A facade for specific data sources.

- **Mapper**: Responsible for mapping objects.

- **Data source**: Wrapper for specific database clients.

- **Entity**: Objects used in logic.

- **Models/DTO**: TypeScript types.

## Database

Although I use MongoDB on a daily basis, I chose DynamoDB for this project due to its availability in the proposed AWS resources. An important aspect to consider in the final product is the implementation of a caching mechanism. Using tools like Redis or solutions available in AWS, such as Amazon ElastiCache, significantly improves application performance, especially when frequently accessing the same data.

## Challenges

- Implementing the Merkle tree was a new experience for me.

- Configuring the application in AWS is challenging, but also a valuable experience. ***(Update)*** Yes, it was challenging, setting all the configurations by trial and error (chatGPT turned out to be helpful). Currently, there is still a problem with envs, which you probably saw in the instructions on how to run the API. The good thing is that in a stress-free moment, learning how to use and set up AWS resources is not a problem.

- I also changed the file structure if you've seen the earlier one and it makes more sense now as the API is separated from libs
